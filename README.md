#boatsoutâ›µ

boatsout is a better version of rent-a-boat using Next.js and Typescript. boatsout is a small project i coded for my friend who works in a boat rental. Now he can use this website to easily track all his boats and manage them. Not only he can use this website now, you can do that aswell if you have a boat rental.
